      <h2>The Trans-Australian Railway (TAR)</h2>
      <p>
        Up until the first part of the 20th century, communications across the
        Australian continent were relatively undeveloped. Perth, the capital of
        Western Australia, remained isolated from Australia's eastern states
        until the Trans-Australian Railway (TAR) was built across the arid area
        known as the Nullarbor (No Trees) Plain. During the 19th century, the
        only form of transport between the west coast and the eastern cities was
        a long and often rough sea voyage across the Great Australian Bight,
        while the first east-west crossing of the Nullarbor Plain on foot was
        achieved by the English explorer Edward Eyre and his indigenous
        Australian guide Wylie in 1841. In 1877 a telegraph line was built
        across the plain, and it was this man-made structure that a mining
        engineer called Arthur Richardson followed, when he set out in 1896 to
        be the first to ride a bicycle around the Australian continent.
